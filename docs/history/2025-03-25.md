+/ask we've added a server and some unit tests.  The server is running and it looks like it "should" work, although I haven't run an actual http request through there yet.  I could just start using the server from the front end now, but I'd like to do something a bit more with automated testing first.  Is now a good time to do something with supertest?

Note how some of the tests in server.test.ts talk to localhost3000 and the healthcheck test does not.  Why are these done differently? Are some of them actually running real requests to an http server in another process?  I wonder if this is part of the disconnect.  The error is below

Let's make it a side panel that animates in and out collapse/expand.  Question 3 is interesting, let's come back to that in a moment.  Question 4 let's hold off on doing anything with that for now, I just want to enter the name and we'll deal with the rest later.  As for question 3, in a moment I will show you what we're doing on the backend and we can discuss it

+/ask Wondering if I should change our conventions.  Would there be a benefit to using plain css instead of scss?  Obviously plain css is simpler, but I'm assuming that I don't have to *use* the additional complexity of scss if I don't want to, but it'll be nice that the power is there for when I need it. And I assume that I will need it eventually for an app of any complexity, such as to use named colors which automatically change everywhere they are used when needed.  Are my assumptions corrects that this extra complexity won't slow me down, because I don't have to use it when I don't want to?  Also I'm thinking about the built pipline in vite: will scss just work, without me having to fiddle with things too much?

+/ask currently the backend start command is using ts-node.  If we change it to nodemon, do we lose whatever special capabilities ts-node was doing for us?

# 2025-03-23 13:31:49.314673
+let's do that, go ahead and change the backend configuration to use nodemon

+Notice how there are id numbers for these stations. In some levels sometimes stations might be dynamically or added later, but for now, the station ids will be static.  Or at least, during initial creation, the station ids are definitely static.  Notice how the station ids referred to in the doc from time to time need comments explaining what they are.  Please modify the doc with station id constants to make it more self documenting

# 2025-03-23 14:02:22.851290
+Notice how there are id numbers for inventory items. In the initial state document, refactor it so that we introduce constants for the inventory item id numbers, and rework the rest of the document example to use these constants to make it more self documenting
