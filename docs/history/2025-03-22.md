+let's start on the front end.  Can you recommend what component(s) we should use in App.tsx? Wondering if we should make a LandingPage component, or a menu component, or how we should break that down.  I know I want a Kitchen component which shows the kitchen and the things in it, but I am not sure if that's the name of the thing we include from App.tsx.  I think I want app.tsx to be very small and lean, though...

+I'd like to think together a moment how we will handle multiplayer, since that's something far easier to think about up front rather than at the end.  I'm thinking about this kind of strategy: on the front end, we'll have the components focused on displaying a state-- rendering.  The changing of state will happen on the backend.  The front end will send events, such as "go to station".  The backend will process that, and send a new state.  If you have other ideas about that, let me know.  Then if we look at App.tsx, I'm thinking that the LandingPage should take as a prop information about who the current player is.  If we have several players, each of those will get a different Player prop object.  Whatever logic we need to figure out who the player is and so on will be something else in App.tsx, and the LandingPage won't have that concern of figuring out the player, it'll be injected as a prop.  How do you feel about these strategies, and do you have alternative ideas you think we should pursue?

+We will use websockets to talk between the front and back end.  Although the client could immediately do predictive state updates to enable lower latency, we will not worry about that for this prototype for simplicity sake.  Also we will send entire state packets from the backend to the front, and although this is a bigger state packet that could be smaller if we sent only events and added a reducer on the front end, we will not be doing that for simplicity sake.

+/ask I want to start a basic backend server. before we start, some design questions.  When working on Python, I've been very successful separating the business logic from the infrastructure logic. "infrastructure" in this case means thinking about things like how is this hosted, how does it talk to the outside world, etc.  This enables me to run the bulk of my code in memory in unit tests, without the concerns of whether we get our events from websockets, event hub, azure storage queues, a batch file, or things in memory. It leads both to greater unit testability (without resorting to integration tests that run real http requests for example) as well as greater flexibility (allowing us to do batch runs of replaying structured log files from production to reproduce things, allowing us to use the same code for local experiments as well as production use, and so on).  First, do you understand this kind of thinking, and is this done in Typescript projects sometimes?  I'm thinking about whether I want to use typescript or python, and what our unit test strategy will look like.

# 2025-03-22 10:30:34.817731
+/ask I'd kind of like to avoid using more dependencies, at least not too many more, if I can.  Hopefully I can just inject my dependencies as needed without needing to use nestjs or friends-- do you think that this will be achievable? (Sorry I'm a python expert not a typescript/javascript expert)

# 2025-03-22 10:32:25.691423
+/ask When I make business objects like this in Python, say a RoomProvider for example, I typically delcare an interface similar to what I'd do in C#, with what methods it has available, and declare the input objects and result objects.  Typically using ABC and Pydantic models.  I imagine I'd do something similar in Typescript.  The part that I'm puzzled about is doing these things just as functions rather than classes/interfaces

# 2025-03-22 10:35:03.499130
+/ask the class based approach seems to declare more explicitly that it is fulfilling the stated contract.  The functional approach this doesn't seem to "pop" as much.  I'm sure it's all strongly typed and sort of implied somehow, or I expect that anyway.  Would people consider the class based approach to be... naive... if they read the code?

# 2025-03-22 10:38:22.243691
+We'll use the class based approach, because the implementations call out explicitly that they fulfill the contract, which makes what's happen easier to grasp more immediately.  Create a new file docs/testing.md that records these ideas about separating the business logic from the infrastructure both for flexibility and allowing better unit testing.  Also I want to record these ideas about contracts and class design in another file docs/contracts.md

# 2025-03-22 10:44:49.234686
+add a section to contracts after the Enhanced Testability that mentions how this can provide additional **flexibility** for the code as well, citing some of my previous examples about multiple input methods and usage scenarios (replaying structured logs captured from production, batch files)

+Start the backend now.  For this step we're just going to create a place for the code to exist and a place to run unit tests on the backend. There should be a server called something like chef backend which won't do anything for now.  we should be able to start the server and run tests.  Update the readme with information on how to install, run, and test the backend.

# 2025-03-22 11:01:53.314903
+/ask is supertest the best way to do this?  I'm aiming for simplicity and keeping the number of dependencies and things I need to learn as low as practical. But if this is a good way and a standard way of doing things I'm here for it

# 2025-03-22 11:04:26.498554
+/ask considering the ideas in contracts.md, that should minimize my need for synthetic http requests. I'll also be doing most things with websockets instead of http requests. So I'm envisioning most of our tests being at the business object level where we've got event objects coming in and states coming out, where they're not thinking about things like HTTP or websockets explicitly most of the time.  But I'm still open to your ideas

# 2025-03-22 11:05:41.771298

It looks like you were running the command in the top level, where package.json does not (and should not!) exist, even though it looks to me like you did a cd backend first.  Any ideas on how we can make this easy to succeed for you when you run the command?

# 2025-03-22 12:24:14.301490
+/ask in a way I like the idea of being able to run either backend or frontend scripts from the top level. But in another way, knowing what dependencies and such are in the backend vs frontend and keeping that separation super clear has been very helpful to me so far. In short, whenever I see changes where a root level package.json is getting created, right now I know that the right things aren't being thought through. So I'm thinking the right way to handle this is keep that clear separation.  Sounds like the --prefix option is the best way forward?

For now we will only use that from the backend; we will import that from the frontend later, using it on the front is out of scope for now.   2. Great callout. I was going to add players later but let's go ahead and do that now.  This means we'll need a Player object in the shared models too.  Go ahead and update the 03-backend-room-provider1.md spec for me too for this and the rest of the answers to your clarifying questions.  3. Yes at this stage we're doing hard coded things. 4. Let's update the existing server tests file.  I realize it's not worth testing hard coded things-- the reality is at this stage I'm just trying to make sure we have a solid foundation established for doing real work.

+. nfrastructure.   Let's figure out our strategy for communicating over the wire. Do we do all communications with one websocket? Or do we instead have http requests / REST calls for finding the list of rooms and so on, and just save the websockets for when someone is in the kitchen and actually playing

# 2025-03-22 13:25:52.807314

I don't want to try to do too much work all at once, I like to plan things in what would take a skilled human about an hour or less to do.  So what would be a good target/success criteria for our next milestone? I want to shoot towards the goal of the server starts an an empty state, a new player arrives, sees that there are no active rooms, and a new room is created and the player is placed in that room. Then later another player arrives, sees the one active room with the one active player, and joins that room as well. Now if we look at the list of active rooms we see one active room with 2 players.  That's what I'm shooting for.  Seems like a human could do all that in about an hour right?  Focusing just on the backend, rest calls only, not worrying about authentication for now.

+/ask why are you using npx to run the server, instead of npm start? I wonder if that is related to what is going wrong, and if I should be running it differently
