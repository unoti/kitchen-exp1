# Kitchen State Generation

## Overview

In this milestone we will implement the initial state management for our kitchen game. The goal is to create an initial state representing an empty kitchen with no players added yet.

## Planned Changes

1. **Backend State and Reducer Implementation:**  
   - Create a module at `backend/kitchenState.ts` that defines the initial state of the kitchen (i.e., empty with no players).
   - Implement a reducer within this module to handle future state transformation actions.

2. **Event Definitions:**  
   - Define event/action types in the shared models (e.g., in a new file under `shared/models/events.ts`) to ensure a consistent contract between the backend and frontend.
   - These actions will later be used by the reducer to update the state.

3. **Testing Setup:**  
   - Write a simple unit test (e.g., in `backend/test/kitchenState.test.ts`) which calls the initial state creation function and, if applicable, the reducer.  
   - The test will verify that the initial kitchen state is created without errors and meets our baseline expectations.
   - Over time, this test will be expanded to include more end-to-end behavior by simulating actions and verifying the resulting state.

## Rationale

- **Modular Design:** Keeping state management in `backend/kitchenState.ts` isolates domain logic from the server initialization, making future refactoring easier.
- **Shared Contracts:** Centralizing event and action definitions in shared models minimizes inconsistencies between frontend and backend code.
- **Incremental Development:** Starting with a minimal test suite ensures that the base functionality is sound before more complex state mutations are introduced.

This setup lays a solid foundation for further enhancements to our kitchen state management system.
