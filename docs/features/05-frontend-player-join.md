# Milestone: player UI for joining room

When a player first comes in, they will need to enter their name and possibly set up other things later
such as their appearance.

Create a PlayerProfile component where a user can type in their name.  Use react fluent <Field>.

Put that component into LandingPage, probably using a fluent Drawer component.

Don't worry about connecting this to the backend yet. For now we'll just focus on getting the UI together.
