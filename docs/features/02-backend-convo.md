#### Start the backend now.  For this step we're just going to create a place for the code to exist and a place to run unit tests on the backend. There should be a server called something like chef backend which won't do anything for now.  we should be able to start the server and run tests.  Update the readme with information on how to install, run, and test the backend.  

Below are the changes I'm proposing:

1. Create a new backend entry point file (`backend/src/index.ts`) that sets up an Express server exposing a “Chef Backend is running!” message.  
2. Create a new backend test file (`backend/test/server.test.ts`) that uses [supertest](https://www.npmjs.com/package/supertest) to test the server’s GET / endpoint.  
3. Update the README to include instructions for installing, starting, and testing the backend.

Please confirm that you’d like to apply these changes.

#### /ask is supertest the best way to do this?  I'm aiming for simplicity and keeping the number of dependencies and things I need to learn as low as practical. But if this is a good way and a standard way of doing things I'm here for it

Supertest is a popular and standard choice for testing HTTP endpoints in Node.js applications—especially when used alongside Express. It allows you to simulate HTTP requests to your server without needing to actually run it on a network port. This makes it ideal for integration testing, and it keeps things relatively simple.

That said, if you're aiming to minimize dependencies and keep your learning curve low, there are a few small considerations:

1. **Learning Curve:** Supertest itself is minimal and easy to learn, especially if you're already familiar with writing tests in Jest or Mocha. The setup is straightforward, so you won’t have much overhead.

2. **Integration Testing:** Since your backend will eventually consist of multiple routes and behaviors, having a robust tool like Supertest now makes it easier to develop comprehensive tests as you add features.

3. **Dependency Overhead:** Supertest is lightweight and gets the job done. Its integration with Express is standard in the Node.js ecosystem, which may save you headaches down the road compared to a more homegrown testing approach.

Overall, Supertest is a good balance—providing enough functionality with minimal extra dependencies. It's a standard and robust way to test your endpoints, so I'd recommend it for your project.

Would you like to proceed with the changes that include setting up an Express server and using Supertest for endpoint testing?

#### /ask considering the ideas in contracts.md, that should minimize my need for synthetic http requests. I'll also be doing most things with websockets instead of http requests. So I'm envisioning most of our tests being at the business object level where we've got event objects coming in and states coming out, where they're not thinking about things like HTTP or websockets explicitly most of the time.  But I'm still open to your ideas  

#### considering the ideas in contracts.md, that should minimize my need for synthetic http requests. I'll also be doing most things with websockets instead of http requests. So I'm envisioning most of our tests being at the business object level where we've got event objects coming in and states coming out, where they're not thinking about things like HTTP or websockets explicitly most of the time.  But I'm still open to your ideas  

Based on your approach described in `contracts.md` and your focus on business objects (with event objects and state transitions) rather than reliance on HTTP, we can keep the HTTP layer extremely minimal. The idea would be to scaffold a simple Express server (or similar) that you can run so that your backend exists as a deployable entity. However, our tests—and most of your work—can and should focus on the business logic directly without needing to simulate HTTP or WebSocket traffic in most cases.

Here’s what I suggest for the initial setup:

1. **Scaffold the Backend Server:**  
   Create a simple backend server (for example, in `backend/src/index.ts`) that listens on a configurable port and simply returns a basic status message on a GET request to `/`. This gives you a quick way to confirm that the server is running. It also reserves a spot for gradually adding WebSocket or HTTP functionality later.

2. **Add a Minimal Test:**  
   Write a unit test (e.g., in `backend/test/server.test.ts`) to ensure that your server is able to start and respond to the health check. This test can use a minimal HTTP request simulation (using a lean tool like Supertest) or you could simply test the business logic without making real HTTP calls. Given your strategy, it might be more beneficial to keep the HTTP testing part very barebones and instead write more comprehensive tests for your business objects (contracts).

3. **Update README for the Backend:**  
   Extend your README with dedicated installation, run, and test instructions for the backend. This ensures that someone (or even future you) will know how to get the backend running and how to run the tests.

In summary, while Supertest is a standard for HTTP endpoint testing, in your case you may only need it for the initial "health check" of your server. All the substantive testing work should focus on directly exercising your business logic—where you provide event objects to your contract handlers and assert that the correct state changes occur. This minimizes dependency on synthetic HTTP requests and keeps your tests focused on the core functionality.

Does this approach align with your goals? Would you like to proceed with setting up the backend with the minimal HTTP scaffold and a corresponding test, plus updating the README accordingly?

#### Please make it so, this is great.  Also update docs\multiplayer.md a bit to reflect these design decisions and a bit of the thinking behind them
