# Milestone: Backend setup

The milestone we're working on now is getting the backend set up.  The backend didn't exist at all
before this step started, and now we're working on getting the backend going.
We're not really trying to do much in this step other than giving us a place to put our code and tests
on the backend and give us a firm foundation to build upon.

## Success Criteria
* Backend and its initial dependencies are installed
* We can run unit tests on the backend
* We can run the server (even though it does nothing or nearly nothing initially)
* README and other associated documentation updated on how to install and run the server.
