# Models reorganization and refactor

Analyze what we have going on with models both on the front end, backend, and also in the shared directory.
We are preparing now to do some changes where the front end starts calling api's on the backend.
Decide what kind of reorganization we want to do with the models.  Like maybe we want to get rid of some of the models on the front end and make them shared instead.  We need to think about what we have, and think about what we want instead, and give provide a briefing of what we want to do.

## Summary of the current situation

## How we want it to be

## Steps to make it the way we want it
