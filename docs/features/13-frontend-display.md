Something claude knocked together

I'm working on a multiplayer cooking game prototype.  The backend is in typescript, and it uses a reducer that can accept a variety of actions from the frontend.  Here's some of the backend reducer code to give you a feel for what's involved in this game.

The frontend sends event messages down the websocket, and you can see what it can send-- things like move to this station, pick up some items, etc.  Based on the stations operations available, you can see that players can for example move over to the utensil area, grab a knife, move to the fridge and grab a few limes, go to the cutting board, put some limes onto it, cut a few limes, take the limes, and move to the juicer... the idea is, in this configuration shown here, to make margaritas or at least limeaide.

I have not yet created the ui yet.  The ui is a web application.  One way I could do the ui at least for a simple prototype is to do it with normal UI elements-- buttons and such, and just render each station as a div.  It's just a prototype to experiment with and "find the fun".  But would it be too much work to do something more, something with animations as chefs move from one station to another, or something else... what would you do for the front end? It has to be easy, I can't spend too much time fiddling with the UI before I have something playable.  But I wonder if I'm selling myself short by just doing plain html and css.  At a minimum maybe I should do css animations to animate chefs as they move between stations... I am not sure


## CSS + Animation Approach (Recommended for Prototype)
This is actually an excellent middle ground between plain HTML and complex animation frameworks.

```html
<!DOCTYPE html>
<html>
<head>
    <style>
        .kitchen-layout {
            display: grid;
            grid-template-columns: repeat(3, 1fr);
            gap: 20px;
            position: relative;
            width: 800px;
            margin: 0 auto;
        }
        .station {
            border: 2px solid #333;
            padding: 10px;
            text-align: center;
            position: relative;
        }
        .chef {
            width: 50px;
            height: 50px;
            background-color: #4CAF50;
            border-radius: 50%;
            position: absolute;
            transition: all 0.5s ease-in-out;
        }
        /* Subtle station hover effect */
        .station:hover {
            background-color: rgba(0,0,0,0.05);
        }
        /* Movement animations */
        @keyframes moveChef {
            from { transform: scale(1); }
            50% { transform: scale(1.1); }
            to { transform: scale(1); }
        }
        .chef-moving {
            animation: moveChef 0.5s linear;
        }
    </style>
</head>
<body>
    <div class="kitchen-layout">
        <div class="station" data-station="Shelf">Shelf</div>
        <div class="station" data-station="Utensils">Utensils</div>
        <div class="station" data-station="Fridge">Fridge</div>
        <div class="station" data-station="CuttingBoard">Cutting Board</div>
        <div class="station" data-station="Juicer">Juicer</div>
        <div class="station" data-station="Stove">Stove</div>
        
        <div class="chef" id="player1"></div>
    </div>
    <script>
        // Simple movement logic
        const stations = document.querySelectorAll('.station');
        const chef = document.getElementById('player1');

        stations.forEach(station => {
            station.addEventListener('click', () => {
                const stationRect = station.getBoundingClientRect();
                chef.style.left = `${stationRect.left + stationRect.width/2 - 25}px`;
                chef.style.top = `${stationRect.top + stationRect.height/2 - 25}px`;
                chef.classList.add('chef-moving');
                setTimeout(() => chef.classList.remove('chef-moving'), 500);
            });
        });
    </script>
</body>
</html>
```

This approach offers:

- Grid-based layout mimicking kitchen stations
- Simple chef movement with CSS transitions
- Subtle hover and movement animations
- Extremely lightweight implementation
- No heavy frameworks required


## Approach 2: React + Framer Motion (If You Want More Sophistication)
If you're open to a bit more complexity, React with Framer Motion can provide rich, physics-based animations with relatively little code.

```ts
import React, { useState } from 'react';
import { motion } from 'framer-motion';

const stations = [
  'Shelf', 'Utensils', 'Fridge', 
  'CuttingBoard', 'Juicer', 'Stove'
];

const KitchenPrototype = () => {
  const [chefPosition, setChefPosition] = useState(stations[0]);

  const moveToStation = (stationName) => {
    setChefPosition(stationName);
  };

  return (
    <div className="kitchen-layout grid grid-cols-3 gap-4 p-4">
      {stations.map(station => (
        <motion.div 
          key={station}
          className="border-2 border-gray-300 p-4 text-center relative"
          whileHover={{ scale: 1.05 }}
          onClick={() => moveToStation(station)}
        >
          {station}
        </motion.div>
      ))}
      
      <motion.div 
        className="absolute w-12 h-12 bg-green-500 rounded-full"
        animate={{
          x: stations.indexOf(chefPosition) % 3 * 200 + 100,
          y: Math.floor(stations.indexOf(chefPosition) / 3) * 150 + 100
        }}
        transition={{ type: "spring", stiffness: 300 }}
      />
    </div>
  );
};

export default KitchenPrototype;
```

Pros of React + Framer Motion:

* More interactive animations
* Physics-based movement
* Easy state management
* Responsive design potential


Quick Considerations:


Start with the CSS approach (first example)
If prototype shows promise, consider React
Avoid over-engineering before proving concept

Recommendations:

* Implement CSS version first
* Focus on core gameplay mechanics
* Add visual polish incrementally
* Get early playtester feedback

The CSS version I showed is literally 50 lines of code but provides a playful, animated feel.
